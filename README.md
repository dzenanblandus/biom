For this project, I used the React framework as the foundation for building the application. I decided to stick with the core React libraries without incorporating any third-party libraries to keep the codebase clean and lightweight. The project approach focused on creating a visually appealing design while ensuring attention to detail throughout the development process. I particularly enjoyed the challenge of implementing complex UI components and managing state efficiently. However, not using any third-party libraries also meant that some functionalities required more manual effort to implement. While I faced a few challenges during the project, such as handling certain  operations, I found it rewarding to overcome them and learn from the experience. As for the estimated time, I allocated approximately 7 days for the project completion.
